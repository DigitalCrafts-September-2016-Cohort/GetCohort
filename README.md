Project Description:
GetCohort is a website designed to comprehensively showcase all of the skills and projects that members of a cohort
have accomplished. By utilizing an easy-to-navigate layout that offers distinct functionality based on the type
of user viewing the site, GetCohort provides a unique perspective on a cohort and the people that comprise it, from
students to instructors and everyone in-between. With just a few clicks, potential employers can find a given student's skill set, view screenshots of projects they have worked on, find classmates they have worked with, and find
contact information or links to their other resources like LinkedIn and Github, all through GetCohort.
